### Notes

* In probability theory, there is a *random process* that gives rise to an *outcome*.
* The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times an outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.
* Probabilities are defined as proportions, and always take values between 0 and 1.
* Law of large numbers: the proportion of occurrences of a given outcome converges to the probability p of that outcome as more observations are collected.
* It can be helpful to model a non-random process as random.
