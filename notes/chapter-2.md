### Notes

* In probability theory, there is a *random process* that gives rise to an *outcome*.
* The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times an outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.
* Probabilities are defined as proportions, and always take values between 0 and 1.
* Law of large numbers: the proportion of occurrences of a given outcome converges to the probability p of that outcome as more observations are collected.
* It can be helpful to model a non-random process as random.
* Two outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen. e.g. you cannot roll both a 1 and a 2 on a die at the same time.
* The probability of disjoint outcomes is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes. *This is called the Addition Rule*.
* We rarely work with single outcomes. Sets of outcomes are written like `{1, 2}`. Sets are referred to as events.
* The "General Addition Rule" allows us to calculate the probability of two events, whether they are disjoint, or not: `P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). A Venn diagram allows us to visualize this. We sum the probability of the two "outer" circles and remove "one" of the intersection probabilities so we're not double counting it.
* When we use "or" in statistics, e.g "A or B", we mean: A, B, or both A and B.
* A probability distribution is a table of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities.
* There are a few rules for probability distributions: 1.) the outcomes listed must be disjoint, 2.) each probability must be between 0 and 1 and 3.) The probabilities must sum to 1.
* Two processes are independent if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other.
* To get the probability of two independent events occurring, you multiply their probabilities. This rule extends to `k` events. This is called the multiplication rule.
* To determine _whether_ two events are independent, check to see if they satisfy the multiplication rule.
